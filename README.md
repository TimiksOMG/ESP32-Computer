<h1>About</h1>
This is an open source computer with a custom language called TimCode and a DOS-like operating system called HamburgerOS<br>

It uses the <b>esp32-s3</b> chip with the <b>ILI9341</b> tft screen as a display.<br>

I made a custom programming language called <b>TimCode</b> for it so i can code the Visual OS or the apps without compiling them.<br>
This also makes it easy to change the Visual OS or the apps, as you don't have to edit the firmware, and vice versa.

<b>Note</b>: The HamburgerOS and the Visual OS are not the same thing. 
The HamburgerOS is a firmware console (like DOS) which runs the TimCode programs
The Visual OS (Can be called differently) is a software OS stored on a SD card, and written in TimCode.<br>
