<h1>About</h1>
This is an open source computer with a custom language called TimCode and a DOS-like operating system called HamburgerOS<br>

It uses the <b>esp32-s3</b> chip with the <b>ILI9341</b> tft screen as a display.<br>

I made a custom programming language called <b>TimCode</b> for it so i can code the the apps without compiling them.<br>
This also makes it easy to change the the apps, as you don't have to edit the firmware
