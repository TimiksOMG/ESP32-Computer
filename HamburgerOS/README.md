<h1>This is the HamburgerOS code.</h1>
Everything is located in <b>console.cpp</b><br><br>

Commands are split by spaces, the first part is called a <b>command</b>, the next 10 are called <b>arguments</b>.
The first part is ran through an if statement which converts it into an enum.
Then the enum gets transferred to a switch, all the logic is there. (Yes i know, this is a stupid system, i will change it later)<br>

Right now TimCode.cpp doesn't work, so i am planning to transfer the logic into console.cpp (there are ~5 lines of code in TimCode.cpp)
